    <h1>Magic the Gathering Commanders I Would Like to Play</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h2><a href="https://edhrec.com/commanders/pantlaza-sun-favored">Pantlaza, Sun-Favored</a></h2>
        <img class="medium" src="https://cards.scryfall.io/large/front/2/5/2524645e-b066-4351-885b-10faa8d819d7.jpg?1699972737" alt="An image showing the card of Pantlaza, Sun-Favored" /
        <p>Pantlaza is a dinosaur tribal commander that says "Whenever Pantlaza, Sun-Favored or another Dinosaur enters the battlefield under your control, you may discover X, where X is that creature's toughness. Do this only once each turn." In case you don't know Discover is a keyword that lets you exile cards from the top of your deck, until you exile a nonland card with that mana value or less. You either cast it without paying the mana cost, or put it into your hand. Then you shuffle all cards exiled this way onto the bottom of your deck in a random order.</p>
        
        <p>The idea for Pantlaza decks is to cheat out expensive creatures by casting dinosaurs with lower mana cost than toughness, such as Curious Altisaur, Topiary Stomper, Wayward Swordtooth, Apex Altisaur, and Ghalta, Primal Hunger.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2><a href="https://edhrec.com/commanders/deadpool-trading-card">Deadpool, Trading Card</a></h2>
        <img class="medium" src="https://cards.scryfall.io/large/front/3/a/3a14d6c5-cfd1-4860-834a-5a0dc9df0320.jpg?1743765756" alt="An image showing the card of Deadpool, Trading Card" />
        <p>Next up is Deadpool, Trading Card. Unlike Pantlaza, who had one really good ability, Deadpool has three decent abilities. The first ability says "As Deadpool enters, you may exchange his text box and another creature's." This works in conjunction with his other abilities, one of which says "At the beginning of your upkeep, you lose three life." His final ability requires you to pay 3 mana, as well as sacrificing the creature with the ability. If you do, each other player draws a card.</p>
        
        <p>The idea with Deadpool is to cast him, give his ability to another player's creature, then use something along the lines of Saw in Half, Blade of Selves, or Helm of the Host to create copies of Deadpool, which will have the original text, not what was stolen from another creature. This means you give an opponent more triggers of those detrimental abilities. You can top it off with something that negates the legend rule, such as The Master, Multiplied or Mirror Box, letting you keep all the good abilities.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2><a href="https://edhrec.com/commanders/ozai-the-phoenix-king">Ozai, The Phoenix King</a></h2>
        <img class="medium" src="https://cards.scryfall.io/large/front/a/9/a98b1550-4609-4a2f-9371-4afe1cdc613e.jpg?1764121744" alt="An image showing the card of Ozai, The Phoenix King" />
        <p>Finally, we have the last entrance, Ozai, the Phoenix King. Ozai has a ton of keywords trample, haste, firebending 4, and, if you have 6 or more unspent mana, he gets flying and indestructible. Normally, this would be difficult because you lose all unsoent </p>
